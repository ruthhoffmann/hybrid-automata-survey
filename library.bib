    abstract = {{Model-checking is a method of verifying concurrent systems in which a state-transition graph model of the system behavior is compared with a temporal logic formula. This paper extends model-checking for the branching-time logic CTL to the analysis of real-time systems, whose correctness depends on the magnitudes of the timing delays. For specifications, we extend the syntax of CTL to allow quantitative temporal operators such as ∃\^{a}¢ <5, meaning "possibly within 5 time units." The formulae of the resulting logic, Timed CTL (TCTL), are interpreted over continuous computation trees, trees in which paths are maps from the set of nonnegative reals to system states. To model finite-state systems we introduce timed graphs-state-transition graphs annotated with timing constraints. As our main result, we develop an algorithm for model-checking, for determining the truth of a TCTL-formula with respect to a timed graph. We argue that choosing a dense domain instead of a discrete domain to model time does not significantly blow up the complexity of the model-checking problem. On the negative side, we show that the denseness of the underlying time domain makes the validity problem for TCTL \^{I} 11-hard. The question of deciding whether there exists a timed graph satisfying a TCTL-formula is also undecidable.}},

We present a temporal logic for specifying such properties and then give a survey of available model-checking techniques for formulae specified in this logic.

@article{Kattenbelt2010,
    abstract = {{In the field of model checking, abstraction refinement has proved to be an extremely successful methodology for combating the state-space explosion problem. However, little practical progress has been made in the setting of probabilistic verification. In this paper we present a novel abstraction-refinement framework for Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are widely used for modelling and verifying systems that exhibit both probabilistic and nondeterministic behaviour. Our framework comprises an abstraction approach based on stochastic two-player games, two refinement methods and an efficient algorithm for an abstraction-refinement loop. The key idea behind the abstraction approach is to maintain a separation between nondeterminism present in the original MDP and nondeterminism introduced during the abstraction process, each type being represented by a different player in the game. Crucially, this allows lower and upper bounds to be computed for the values of reachability properties of the MDP. These give a quantitative measure of the quality of the abstraction and form the basis of the corresponding refinement methods. We describe a prototype implementation of our framework and present experimental results demonstrating automatic generation of compact, yet precise, abstractions for a large selection of real-world case studies.}},

We present symbolic model-checking algorithms for probabilistic timed automata to verify both qualitative temporal logic properties, corresponding to satisfaction with probability 0 or 1, and quantitative properties, corresponding to satisfaction with arbitrary probability. The algorithms operate on zones, which represent sets of valuations of the probabilistic timed automaton's clocks. Our method considers only those system behaviours which guarantee the divergence of time with probability 1. The paper presents a symbolic framework for the verification of probabilistic timed automata against the probabilistic, timed temporal logic PTCTL.

For analysis purposes, it is often useful to abstract a system in a way that preserves the properties being analysed while hiding the details that are of no interest. We show that interesting classes of hybrid systems can be abstracted to purely discrete systems while preserving all properties that are definable in temporal logic. The classes that permit discrete abstractions fall into two categories. Either the continuous dynamics must be restricted, as is the case for timed and rectangular hybrid systems, or the discrete dynamics must be restricted, as is the case for o-minimal hybrid systems.

Sci. 126 (1994) 183–235), which allows the analysis of real-time systems expressed in terms of quantitative timing constraints. Traditional approaches to real-time system description express the model purely in terms of nondeterminism; however, it is often desirable to express the likelihood of the system making certain transitions. In this paper, we present a model for real-time systems augmented with discrete probability distributions. Furthermore, two approaches to model checking are introduced for this model. The first uses the algorithm of Baier and Kwiatkowska (Distributed Comput. 11 (1998) 125–155) to provide a verification technique against temporal logic formulae which can refer both to timing properties and probabilities. The second, generally more efficient, technique concerns the verification of probabilistic, real-time reachability properties.}},

    abstract = {{A formalism for specifying probabilistic transition systems, which constitute a basic semantic model for description and analysis of, e.g. reliability aspects of concurrent and distributed systems, is presented. The formalism itself is based on transition systems. Roughly a specification has the form of a transition system in which transitions are labeled by sets of allowed probabilities. A satisfaction relation between processes and specifications that generalizes probabilistic bisimulation equivalence is defined. It is shown that it is analogous to the extension from processes to modal transition systems given by K. Larsen and B. Thomsen (1988). Another weaker criterion views a specification as defining a set of probabilistic processes; refinement is then simply containment between sets of processes. A complete method for verifying containment between specifications, which extends methods for deciding containment between specifications, which extends methods for deciding containment between finite automata or tree acceptors, is presented}},

    abstract = {{This paper considers the quantitative verification of discrete-time stochastic hybrid systems (DTSHS) against linear time objectives. The central question is to determine the likelihood of all the trajectories in a DTSHS that are accepted by an automaton on finite or infinite words. This verification covers regular and ω-regular properties, and thus comprises the linear temporal logic LTL. This work shows that these quantitative verification problems can be reduced to computing reachability probabilities over the product of an automaton and the DTSHS under study. The computation of reachability probabilities can be performed in a backward-recursive manner, and quantitatively approximated by procedures over discrete-time Markov chains. A case study shows the feasibility of the approach.}},

@article{Abate2010,
    abstract = {{A method for approximate model checking of stochastic hybrid systems with provable approximation guarantees is proposed. We focus on the probabilistic invariance problem for discrete time stochastic hybrid systems and propose a two-step scheme. The stochastic hybrid system is first approximated by a finite state Markov chain. The approximating chain is then model checked for probabilistic invariance. Under certain regularity conditions on the transition and reset kernels governing the dynamics of the stochastic hybrid system, the invariance probability computed using the approximating Markov chain is shown to converge to the invariance probability of the original stochastic hybrid system, as the grid used in the approximation gets finer. A bound on the convergence rate is also provided. The performance of the two-step approximate model checking procedure is assessed on a case study of a multi-room heating system.}},

@article{Alur1994,
    abstract = {{We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior of real-time systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many real-valued clocks. A timed automaton accepts timed words–infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both B\"{u}chi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the paper is an (PSPACE) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also prove that the universality problem and the language inclusion problem are solvable only for the deterministic automata: both problems are undecidable (Π11-hard) in the nondeterministic case and PSPACE-complete in the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss the application of this theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of finite-state systems.}},

We model hybrid systems as finite automata equipped with variables that evolve continuously with time according to dynamical laws. For verification purposes, we restrict ourselves to linear hybrid systems, where all variables follow piecewise-linear trajectories. We provide decidability and undecidability results for classes of linear hybrid systems, and we show that standard program-analysis techniques can be adapted to linear hybrid systems. In particular, we consider symbolic model-checking and minimization procedures that are based on the reachability analysis of an infinite state space. The procedures iteratively compute state sets that are definable as unions of convex polyhedra in multidimensional real space. We also present approximation techniques for dealing with systems for which the iterative procedures do not converge.}},
