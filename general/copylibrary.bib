abstract = {This chapter describes several classes of sentence-generating devices that are closely related, in various ways, to the grammars of both natural languages and artificial languages of various kinds. Language means simply a set of strings in some finite set V of symbols called the vocabulary of the language. Grammar essentially means a set of rules that give a recursive enumeration of the strings belonging to the language. It is noted that for a class of grammars to have linguistic interest, there must be a procedure that assigns to any pair ($\sigma$, G), where $\sigma$ is a string and G a grammar of this class. In particular, the structural description indicates that the string $\sigma$ is a well-formed sentence of the language L (G) generated by G. However, the chapter concerns with only one aspect of the structural description of a sentence—namely, its subdivision into phrases belonging to various categories.},

abstract = {We present a general framework for the formal specification and algorithmic analysis of hybrid systems. A hybrid system consists of a discrete program with an analog environment. We model hybrid systems as finite automata equipped with variables that evolve continuously with time according to dynamical laws. For verification purposes, we restrict ourselves to linear hybrid systems, where all variables follow piecewise-linear trajectories. We provide decidability and undecidability results for classes of linear hybrid systems, and we show that standard program-analysis techniques can be adapted to linear hybrid systems. In particular, we consider symbolic model-checking and minimization procedures that are based on the reachability analysis of an infinite state space. The procedures iteratively compute state sets that are definable as unions of convex polyhedra in multidimensional real space. We also present approximation techniques for dealing with systems for which the iterative procedures do not converge.},

abstract = {Probabilistic model checking is a powerful technique for formally verifying quantitative properties of systems that exhibit stochastic behaviour. Such systems are found in many domains: probabilistic behaviour may arise, for example, due to failures of unreliable components, communication across lossy media, or through the use of randomisation in distributed protocols. In this paper, we give a short overview of probabilistic model checking and of PRISM (www.prismmodelchecker.org), currently the leading software tool in this area. We then mention some of the limitations of these techniques, describe some of the advances that are being made to overcome them, and outline key challenges that remain in this research area.},

In both cases, these enumerations were known implicitly, by working backwards from the enumeration of the class, but the simple permutations had not been enumerated explicitly. In particular, the enumeration of the simple skew-merged permutations leads to the first truly structural enumeration of this class as a whole.

However, the idea of having an ad-ditional 'governor' that assesses options the system has, and prunes them to select the most ethical choices is well under-stood. Recent work has produced such a governor consisting of a 'consequence engine' that assesses the likely future out-comes of actions then applies a Safety/Ethical logic to select actions. Although this is appealing, it is impossible to be cer-tain that the most ethical options are actually taken. In this paper we extend and apply a well-known agent verification approach to our consequence engine, allowing us to verify the correctness of its ethical decision-making.},

In order to assess swarm effectiveness, either experi- ments with real robots or computational simulations of the swarm are usually carried out.

In this paper we will utilise automated formal verification techniques, involving an exhaustive mathematical analysis, in order to assess whether our swarms will indeed behave as required.},

Some necessary conditions of the optimal solutions of such a system are derived based on the as- sumption that there is a group of symmetries acting uniformly on the domains of different discrete modes, such that the Lagrangian functions, the guards, and the reset maps are all invariant under the action. La- grangian reduction approach is adopted to establish the conservation law of certain quantities for the optimal solutions. Some examples are pre- sented. In particular, the problems of optimal collision avoidance (OCA) and optimal formation switching (OFS) of multiple agents moving on a Riemannian manifold are studied in some details.},

abstract = {We show that if two finite Kripke structures can be distinguished by some CTL* formula that contains both branching-time and linear-time operators, then the structures can be distinguished by a CTL formula that contains only branching-time operators. Our proof involves showing that, for any finite Kripke structure M, it is possible to construct a CTL formula FM that uniquely characterizes M. Since one Kripke structure may be a trivial unrolling of another, we use a notion of equivalence between Kripke structures that is similar to the notion of bisimulation studied by Milner [15]. Our first construction of FM requires the use of the nexttime operator. We also consider the case in which the nexttime operator is disallowed in CTL formulae. The proof, in this case, requires another notion of equivalence-equivalence with respect to stuttering and is much more difficult since it is possible for two inequivalent states to have exactly the same finite behaviors (modulo stuttering), but different infinite behaviors. We also give a polynomial algorithm for determining if two structures are stuttering equivalent and discuss the relevance of our results for temporal logic model checking and synthesis procedures. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {This paper investigates how formal techniques can be used for the analysis and verification of hybrid systems [1, 5, 7, 16] - systems involving both discrete and continuous behavior. The motivation behind such research lies in the inherent similarity of the hierarchical and decentralized control strategies of hybrid systems and the communication and operation protocols used for distributed systems in computer science. This paper focuses on the use of hybrid I/O automata [11,12] to model, analyze, and verify safety-critical hybrid systems that use emergency control subsystems to prevent the violation of their safety requirements. The paper is split into two parts. First, we develop an abstract model of a protector - an emergency control component that guarantees that the physical plant at hand adheres to a particular safety requirement. The abstract protector model specialized to a particular physical plant and a particular safety requirement constitutes the specification of a protector that enforces the particular safety property for the particular physical plant. The correctness proof of the abstract protector model leads to simple correctness proofs of the implementations of particular protectors. In addition, the composition of independent protectors, and even dependent protectors under mild conditions, guarantees the conjunction of the safety properties guaranteed by the individual protectors being composed. Second, as a case study, we specialize the aforementioned abstract protector model to simplified versions of the personal rapid transit system (PRT 2000(TM)) under development at Raytheon Corporation and verify the correctness of overspeed and collision avoidance protectors. Such correctness proofs are repeated for track topologies ranging from a single track to a directed graph of tracks involving Y-shaped merges and diverges.},

We target systems with a set of non-trivial, but interchangeable, components such as those which commonly arise in randomised distributed algorithms or probabilistic communication protocols. We show, for three types of probabilistic models, that symmetry reduction, similarly to the non-probabilistic case, allows verification to instead be performed on a bisimilar quotient model which may be up to factorially smaller. We then propose an efficient algorithm for the construction of the quotient model using a symbolic implementation based on multi-terminal binary decision diagrams (MTBDDs) and, using four large case studies, demonstrate that this approach offers not only a dramatic increase in the size of probabilistic model which can be quantitatively analysed but also a significant decrease in the corresponding run-times.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new intelligent agent framework that combines rational decision making with abstractions of sensing and actions for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) control systems. The objective of the new framework is to provide self tuning and more adaptability to an onboard autopilot. This is achieved through controlloer switching and tuning by the agent in face of dynamic changes affecting the plane due to aerodynamic and onboard system changes. The framework integrates onboard dynamical system identification, hybrid adaptive control, model validation and diagnosis. The agent, tuning and supervising the autopilot, also operates real-time evaluations of abstractions on the effects of its actions in the future. The methods are demonstrated in simulation on a benchmark performance of an Aerosonde UAV.},

abstract = {Autonomous systems such as unmanned vehicles are beginning to operate within society. All participants in society are required to follow specific regulations and laws. An autonomous system cannot be an exception. Inevitably an autonomous system will find itself in a situation in which it needs to not only choose to obey a rule or not, but also make a complex ethical decision. However, there exists no obvious way to implement the human understanding of ethical behaviour in computers. Even if we enable autonomous systems to distinguish between more and less ethical alternatives, how can we be sure that they would choose right? We consider autonomous systems with a hybrid architecture in which the highest level of reasoning is executed by a rational (BDI) agent. For such a system, formal verification has been used successfully to prove that specific rules of behaviour are observed when making decisions. We propose a theoretical framework for ethical plan selection that can be formally verified. We implement a rational agent that incorporates a given ethical policy in its plan selection and show that we can formally verify that the agent chooses to execute, to the best of its beliefs, the most ethical available plan.},

We present a tool, Spin-to-Grape, which allows the state-graph of a Promela model to be manipulated using the group-theoretic package Gap and its graph-theoretic add on, Grape. Through studying these examples we show a correspondence between the symmetry group of the channel diagram of a system and the symmetry group of the Kripke structure associated with the system. We then identify some general classes of systems and describe the symmetry groups of the associated models. Finally we discuss ways in which symmetry reduction techniques incorporated within Spin, e.g. the SymmSpin package, could be extended to exploit symmetry in such models. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{FAlgsEnumAllCommIntsof2Perms,
abstract = {Given two permutations of n elements, a pair of intervals of these permutations consisting of the same set of elements is called a it common interval. Some genetic algorithms based on such common intervals have been proposed for sequencing problems and have exhibited good prospects. In this paper, we propose three types of fast algorithms to enumerate all common intervals: i) a simple O(n 2) time algorithm (LHP), whose expected running time becomes O(n) for two randomly generated permutations, ii) a practically fast O(n 2) time algorithm (MNG) using the reverse Monge property, and iii) an O(n+K) time algorithm (RC), where K (leq n choose 2) is the number of common intervals. It will be also shown that the expected number of common intervals for two random permutations is O(1). This result gives a reason for the phenomenon that the expected time complexity O(n) of the algorithm LHP is independent of K. Among the proposed algorithms, RC is most desirable from the theoretical point of view; however, it is quite complicated compared to LHP and MNG. Therefore, it is possible that RC is slower than the other two algorithms in some cases. For this reason, computational experiments for various types of problems with up to n=10 6 are conducted. The results indicate that i) LHP and MNG are much faster than RC for two randomly generated permutations, and ii) MNG is rather slower than LHP for random inputs; however, there are cases that LHP requires $\Omega$(n 2) time, but MNG runs in o(n 2) time and is faster than both LHP and RC.},

abstract = {We present a verification methodology for analysing the decision-making component in agent-based hybrid systems. Traditionally hybrid automata have been used to both implement and verify such systems, but hybrid automata based modelling, programming and verification techniques scale poorly as the complexity of discrete decision-making increases making them unattractive in situations where complex logical reasoning is required. In the programming of complex systems it has, therefore, become common to separate out logical decision-making into a separate, discrete, component. However, verification techniques have failed to keep pace with this development. We are exploring agent-based logical components and have developed a model checking technique for such components which can then be composed with a separate analysis of the continuous part of the hybrid system. Among other things this allows program model checkers to be used to verify the actual implementation of the decision-making in hybrid autonomous systems.},

In the last few years there has been a growing interest in the use of symbolic models as a tool for mitigating complexity in control design. In fact, symbolic models enable the use of well known algorithms in the context of supervisory control and algorithmic game theory, for controller synthesis. Since the 1990's many researchers faced the problem of identifying classes of dynamical and control systems that admit symbolic models. In this paper we make a further progress along this research line by focusing on control systems affected by disturbances. Our main contribution is to show that incrementally globally asymptotically stable nonlinear control systems with disturbances admit symbolic models. When specializing these results to linear systems, we show that these symbolic models can be easily constructed.},

Consequently, existing symmetry reduction packages can only exploit full symmetry between system components, as checking the equivalence of states is straightforward in this special case. We present a framework for symmetry reduction with an arbitrary group of structural symmetries. By generalising existing techniques for efficiently exploiting symmetry, and introducing an approximate strategy for use with groups for which fast, exact strategies are not available, our approach allows for significant state-space reduction with minimal time overhead. We show how computational group theoretic techniques can be used to analyse the structure of a symmetry group so that an appropriate symmetry reduction strategy can be chosen, and we describe a symmetry reduction package for the Spin model checker which interfaces with the computational algebra system Gap. Experimental results on a variety of Promela models illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.},

abstract = {Model checkers for program verification have enjoyed considerable success in recent years. In the control systems domain, however, they suffer from an inability to account for the physical environment. For control systems, simulation is the most widely used approach for validating system designs. We present a new technique for finding counterexamples that uses a software model checker to perform a systematic simulation of the software implementation of a controller coupled with a continuous plant. Instead of performing a large set of independent simulations, our approach uses the model checking notion of state-space exploration by piecing together numerical simulations of the plant and transitions of the controller. Our implementation of this technique uses an explicit-state source-code model checker to analyze the software and the MATLAB/Simulink environment to model and simulate the plant. We present an illustrative example involving a supervisory controller for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We show that our technique is able to detect an error in the controller design.},

The distinguishing feature of the proposed methodology is that it rests on the approximation of the solution to stochastic differential equations by using Markov chains. From an algorithmic point of view, the probability of entering the target set is computed by appropriately propagating the transition probabilities of the Markov chain backwards in time starting fromthe target set during the time horizon of interest.We consider air traffic management as an application example. Specifically, we address the problem of estimating the probability that two aircraft flying in the same region of the airspace get closer than a certain safety distance and that an aircraft enters a forbidden airspace area. In this context, the target set is the set of unsafe configurations for the system, and we are estimating the probability that an unsafe situation occurs.},

abstract = {We present a verification methodology for analysing the decision-making component in agent-based hybrid systems. Traditionally hybrid automata have been used to both implement and verify such systems, but hybrid automata based modelling, programming and verification techniques scale poorly as the complexity of discrete decision-making increases making them unattractive in situations where complex logical reasoning is required. In the programming of complex systems it has, therefore, become common to separate out logical decision-making into a separate, discrete, component. However, verification techniques have failed to keep pace with this development. We are exploring agent-based logical components and have developed a model checking technique for such components which can then be composed with a separate analysis of the continuous part of the hybrid system. Among other things this allows program model checkers to be used to verify the actual implementation of the decision-making in hybrid autonomous systems.},

abstract = {Over the last decade there has been much interest in exploiting symmetry to combat the state explosion problem in model checking. Although symmetry in a model often arises as a result of symmetry in the topology of the system being modelled, most model checkers which exploit structural symmetry are limited to topologies which exhibit total symmetries, such as stars and cliques. We define the static channel diagram of a concurrent, message passing program, and show that under certain restrictions there is a correspondence between symmetries of the static channel diagram of a program and symmetries of the Kripke structure associated with the program. This allows the detection, and potential exploitation, of structural symmetry in systems with arbitrary topologies. Our method of symmetry detection can handle mobile systems where channel references are passed on channels, resulting in a dynamic communication structure. We illustrate our results with an example using the Promela modelling language. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A hybrid system is modeled with a finite set of locations and a differential inclusion associated with each location. We discuss a subclass of hybrid systems with constant rectangular differential inclusions. The continuous state of the system is x IRn with xi evolving with differential inclusion xi [Li, Ui] where Li, Ui are integers (i.e., the slope of trajectory of xi could be changing, but is restricted to remain within [Li, Ui]). A transition from one location to another can be made provided the state satisfies the enabling condition for the transition. The state can also be initialized to a new value during the transition. The differential inclusion for xi can be changed when xi is an integer or when xi is initialized to a new value. We show that the verification problem for this class of hybrid systems is decidable. With this approach, systems with unsynchronized and drifting clocks can be modeled, a general differential equation can be abstracted by breaking the state space into regions with constant differential inclusions, and many previously presented hybrid system examples can be verified.},

The standard approach to representative computation involves converting a state to its minimal image under a permutation group G, before storing the state. This is known as the Constructive orbit problem (COP), and is NP hard. It may be possible to solve the COP efficiently if G is known to have certain structural properties: in particular if G is isomorphic to a full symmetry group, or G is a disjoint/wreath product of subgroups. We extend existing results on solving the COP efficiently for fully symmetric groups, and investigate the problem of automatically classifying an arbitrary permutation group as a disjoint/wreath product of subgroups. We also present an approximate COP strategy based on local search, and some computational group-theoretic optimisations to improve the basic approach of solving the COP by symmetry group enumeration. Experimental results using the \topspin\ symmetry reduction package, which interfaces with the computational group-theoretic system GAP, illustrate the effectiveness of our techniques.},

Indeed, we show that a class of mathematical models that describe the dynamics of collective behavior can be generated using the individual robot controller as modeling blueprint. We illustrate the macroscopic modelling methods with the help of a few sample results gathered in distributed manipulation experiments (collaborative stick pulling, foraging, aggregation). We compare the models{\^{a}} predictions to results of probabilistic numeric and sensor-based simulations as well as experiments with real robots.

We introduce a hybrid mode estimation system that extracts mode estimates from subtle symptoms.

We describe a tool, SymmExtractor, which, for a given model and LTL property, uses our approach to find a group of symmetries of the model which preserve the property. This group can then be used for symmetry reduction during model checking using existing quotient-based methods. Unlike previous approaches, our method can detect arbitrary structural symmetries arising from the communication structure of the model.},

This procedure uses ideas from predicate abstraction to abstract the discrete dynamics and qualitative reasoning to abstract the continuous dynamics of the hybrid system. It relies on the ability to decide satisfiability of quantifier-free formulae in some theory rich enough to encode the hybrid system. We characterize the sets of predicates that can be used to create high quality abstractions and we present new approaches to discover such useful sets of predicates. Under certain assumptions, the abstraction procedure can be applied compositionally to abstract a hybrid system described as a composition of two hybrid automata. We show that the constructed abstractions are always sound, but are relatively complete only under certain assumptions.},

Traditionally hybrid automata have been used to both implement and verify such systems, but hybrid automata based modelling, programming and verification techniques scale poorly as the complexity of discrete decision-making increases making them unattractive in situations where complex logical reasoning is required. In the programming of complex systems it has, therefore, become common to separate out logical decision-making into a separate, discrete, component. However, verification techniques have failed to keep pace with this development. We are exploring agent-based logical components and have developed a model checking technique for such components which can then be composed with a separate analysis of the continuous part of the hybrid system. Among other things this allows program model checkers to be used to verify the actual implementation of the decision-making in hybrid autonomous systems.},

Such swarms have been shown to be adaptable, fault-tolerant and widely applicable. However, designing individual robot algorithms to ensure effective and correct overall swarm behaviour is actually very difficult. While mechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of any swarm algorithm before deployment are essential, such mechanisms have traditionally involved either computational simulations of swarm behaviour, or experiments with robot swarms themselves. However, such simulations or experiments cannot, by their nature, analyse all possible swarm behaviours. In this paper, we will develop and apply the use of automated probabilistic formal verification techniques to robot swarms, involving an exhaustive mathematical analysis, in order to assess whether swarms will indeed behave as required.

@book{Baier2008,
abstract = {Our growing dependence on increasingly complex computer and software systems necessitates the development of formalisms, techniques, and tools for assessing functional properties of these systems. One such technique that has emerged in the last twenty years is model checking, which systematically (and automatically) checks whether a model of a given system satisfies a desired property such as deadlock freedom, invariants, or request-response properties. This automated technique for verification and debugging has developed into a mature and widely used approach with many applications. Principles of Model Checking offers a comprehensive introduction to model checking that is not only a text suitable for classroom use but also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the field. The book begins with the basic principles for modeling concurrent and communicating systems, introduces different classes of properties (including safety and liveness), presents the notion of fairness, and provides automata- based algorithms for these properties. It introduces the temporal logics LTL and CTL, compares them, and covers algorithms for verifying these logics, discussing real-time systems as well as systems subject to random phenomena. Separate chapters treat such efficiency-improving techniques as abstraction and symbolic manipulation. The book includes an extensive set of examples (most of which run through several chapters) and a complete set of basic results accompanied by detailed proofs. Each chapter concludes with a summary, bibliographic notes, and an extensive list of exercises of both practical and theoretical nature.},

Desirable properties of the mission such as liveness are specified in Computation Tree Logic (CTL).

Such swarms have been shown to be adaptable, fault-tolerant and widely applicable. However, designing individual robot algorithms to ensure effective and correct overall swarm behaviour is actually very difficult. While mechanisms for assessing the effectiveness of any swarm algorithm before deployment are essential, such mechanisms have traditionally involved either computational simulations of swarm behaviour, or experiments with robot swarms themselves. However, such simulations or experiments cannot, by their nature, analyse all possible swarm behaviours. In this paper, we will develop and apply the use of automated probabilistic formal verification techniques to robot swarms, involving an exhaustive mathematical analysis, in order to assess whether swarms will indeed behave as required.

abstract = {Geometric grid classes and the substitution decomposition have both been shown to be fundamental in the understanding of the structure of permutation classes. In particular, these are the two main tools in the recent classification of permutation classes of growth rate less than $\kappa\approx2.20557$ (a specific algebraic integer at which infinite antichains begin to appear). Using language- and order-theoretic methods, we prove that the substitution closures of geometric grid classes are partially well-ordered, finitely based, and that all their subclasses have algebraic generating functions. We go on to show that the inflation of a geometric grid class by a strongly rational class is partially well-ordered, and that all its subclasses have rational generating functions. This latter fact allows us to conclude that every permutation class with growth rate less than $\kappa$ has a rational generating function. This bound is tight as there are permutation classes with growth rate $\kappa$ which have nonrational generating functions.},

abstract = {Hybrid dynamic systems include both continuous and discrete state variables. Properties of hybrid systems, which have an infinite state space, can often be verified using ordinary model checking together with a finite-state abstraction. Model checking can be inconclusive, however, in which case the abstraction must be refined. This paper presents a new procedure to perform this refinement operation for abstractions of infinite-state systems, in particular of hybrid systems. Following an approach originally developed for finite-state systems, the refinement procedure constructs a new abstraction that eliminates a counterexample generated by the odel checker. For hybrid systems, analysis of the counterexample requires the computation of sets of reachable states in the continuous state space. We show how such reachability computations with varying degrees of complexity can be used to refine hybrid system abstractions efficiently. A detailed example illustrates our counterexample-guided refinement procedure. Experimental results for a prototype implementation of the procedure indicate its advantages over existing methods.},

We build upon state-of-the-art techniques and tools, using SAT-based predicate abstraction, symbolic implementations of probabilistic model checking and components from GOTO-CC, SATABS and PRISM. Experimental results show that our approach performs very well in practice, successfully verifying actual networking software whose complexity is significantly beyond the scope of existing probabilistic verification tools.},

Under certain regularity conditions on the transition and reset kernels governing the dynamics of the stochastic hybrid system, the invariance probability com- puted using the approximating Markov chain is shown to converge to the invariance probability of the original stochastic hybrid system, as the grid used in the approximation gets finer.

abstract = {Model checking is a well-established technique for the formal verification of concurrent and distributed systems. In recent years, model checking has been extended and adapted for multi-agent systems, primarily to enable the formal analysis of belief-desire-intention systems. While this has been successful, there is a need for more complex logical frameworks in order to verify realistic multi-agent systems. In particular, probabilistic and real-time aspects, as well as knowledge, belief, goals, etc., are required. However, the development of new model checking tools for complex combinations of logics is both difficult and time consuming. In this article, we show how model checkers for the constituent temporal, probabilistic, and real-time logics can be re-used in a modular way when we consider combined logics involving different dimensions. This avoids the re-implementation of model checking procedures. We define a modular approach, prove its correctness, establish its complexity, and show how it can be used to describe existing combined approaches and define yet-unimplemented combinations. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a case study. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {A robot swarm is a collection of simple robots designed to work together to carry out some task. Such swarms rely on the simplicity of the individual robots; the fault tolerance inherent in having a large population of identical robots; and the self-organised behaviour of the swarm as a whole. Although robot swarms present an attractive solution to demanding real-world applications, designing individual control algorithms that can guarantee the required global behaviour is a difficult problem. In this paper we assess and apply the use of formal verification techniques for analysing the emergent behaviours of robotic swarms. These techniques, based on the automated analysis of systems using temporal logics, allow us to analyse whether all possible behaviours within the robot swarm conform to some required specification. In particular, we apply model-checking, an automated and exhaustive algorithmic technique, to check whether temporal properties are satisfied on all the possible behaviours of the system. We target a particular swarm control algorithm that has been tested in real robotic swarms, and show how automated temporal analysis can help to refine and analyse such an algorithm. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper, we consider a multi-robot cooperative control problem via a robust consensus tracking algorithm. The main objective of this paper is to develop and implement a multi-robot formation control testbed and use it to verify the effectiveness of a cooperative control algorithm developed in our recent work. In the robust consensus tracking algorithm, an observer is developed to identify the disturbances and uncertainties in the information dynamics, and a consensus law is developed based on this observer to enable the robots reach a consensus on their understanding of the reference trajectory. A low-level motion controller is then used to control the robots to track their desired trajectories computed from the consensus value. In the experimental development, a group of wheeled mobile robots achieve a global behavior (e.g., track a time-varying desired trajectory) while maintaining a formation. The desired reference trajectory is only provided to a small group of leading robots.},

@article{Fehnker2004,
abstract = {There are numerous application examples for hybrid systems verification in recent literature. Most of them were introduced to illustrate a new approach to hybrid systems verification, and are therefore of a limited size. Others are case studies that serve to prove that an approach can be applied to real world problems. Verification of these typically requires a lot of domain experience to obtain a tractable, verifiable model. Verification of a case study yields a singular result that is hard to compare and time-consuming to reproduce. This paper introduces three benchmarks for hybrid systems verification. These benchmarks are independent from a particular approach to verification, they have a limited domain, and have a simple basic structure. Nevertheless, these benchmarks can be scaled to arbitrary complexity, and offer the possibility to inject phenomena that are known to be problematic in hybrid verification. This paper presents result for a first set of instances, as an example of how these benchmark can be used to compare different tools and approaches.},

The other direction is proved by a more general result that allows the construction of infinite antichains in any grid class of a matrix whose graph has a component containing two or more non-monotone-griddable cells. The construction uses a generalisation of pin sequences to grid classes, together with a number of symmetry operations on the rows and columns of a gridding.},

Furthermore, we present model checking for abstract probabilistic systems (abstract Markov chains) with respect to specifications in probabilistic temporal logics, interpreted over a 3-valued domain. More specifically, we introduce a 3-valued version of probabilistic computation-tree logic (PCTL) and give a model checking algorithm w.r.t. abstract Markov chains.},

@article{Donaldson2010,
abstract = {The application of model checking is limited due to the state-space explosion problem – as the number of components represented by a model increase, the worst case size of the associated state-space grows exponentially.  Current techniques can handle limited kinds of symmetry, e.g. full symmetry between identical components in a concurrent system.  They avoid the problem of automatic symmetry detection by requiring the user to specify the presence of symmetry in a model (explicitly, or by annotating the associated specification using additional language keywords), or by restricting the input language of a model checker so that only symmetric systems can be specified.  Additionally, computing unique representatives for each symmetric equivalence class is easy for these limited kinds of symmetry.

We present a theoretical framework for symmetry reduction which can be applied to explicit state model checking.  The framework includes techniques for automatic symmetry detection using computational group theory, which can be applied with no additional user input.  These techniques detect structural symmetries induced by the topology of a concurrent system, so our framework includes exact and approximate techniques to efficiently exploit arbitrary symmetry groups which may arise in this way.  These techniques are also based on computational group theoretic methods.

We prove that our framework is logically sound, and demonstrate its general applicability to explicit state model checking.  By providing a new symmetry reduction package for the SPIN model checker, we show that our framework can be feasibly implemented as part of a system which is widely used in both industry and academia.  Through a study of SPIN users, we assess the usability of our automatic symmetry detection techniques in practice.},

@article{Miller2007,
abstract = {We investigate the relationship between symmetry reduction and inductive reasoning when applied to model checking networks of featured components. Popular reduction techniques for combatting state space explosion in model checking, like abstraction and symmetry reduction, can only be applied effectively when the natural symmetry of a system is not destroyed during specification. We introduce a property which ensures this is preserved, open symmetry. We describe a template-based approach for the construction of open symmetric Promela specifications of featured systems. For certain systems (safely featured parameterised systems) our generated specifications are suitable for conversion to abstract specifications representing any size of network. This enables feature interaction analysis to be carried out, via model checking and induction, for systems of any number of featured components. In addition, we show how, for any balanced network of components, by using a graphical representation of the features and the process communication structure, a group of permutations of the underlying state space of the generated specification can be determined easily. Due to the open symmetry of our Promela specifications, this group of permutations can be used directly for symmetry reduced model checking. The main contributions of this paper are an automatic method for developing open symmetric specifications which can be used for generic feature interaction analysis, and the novel application of symmetry detection and reduction in the context of model checking featured networks. We apply our techniques to a well known example of a featured network - an email system. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Examples of such systems include wireless sensing and control applications. We propose and compare two abstraction techniques for this class of models, which yield lower and upper bounds on the optimal probability of reaching a particular class of states. We also demonstrate the applicability of these abstraction techniques to the computation of long-run average reward properties and the synthesis of controllers. The first of the two abstractions yields more precise information, while the second is easier to construct. For the latter, we demonstrate how existing solvers for hybrid systems can be leveraged to perform the computation.},

abstract = {Although the continuous safety technology advances in fields like air traffic control (ATC) systems or medical devices, the crux of safety assurance still comes down to human decision makers, which, within the context of having to define priorities while simultaneously considering different contextual criteria, present a constant high risk of erroneous decisions. We illustrate in this article a recommender framework for assisting flight controllers, which combines argumentation theory and model checking in the evaluation of trade-offs and compromises to be made in the presence of incomplete and potentially inconsistent information. We view a Hybrid Kripke model as a description of an ATC domain and we apply a rational decision strategy based on Hybrid Logics and Defeasible Reasoning to assist the process of model update when the system has to accommodate new properties or norm constraints. When the model fails to verify a property, a defeasible logic program is used to analyze the current state and perform updating operations on the model. The introduced decision making framework is tested on a recommender system in ATC and model update is demonstrated with respect to the verification and adaption of unmanned aerial vehicles routes in the air traffic space. The results show an important potential for the presented framework to be integrated directly into existing decision-making routines for achieving higher accuracy in recommender system methods.},

In the case of o-minimal hybrid systems, the continuous and discrete components can be decoupled, and hence, the problem reduces in building a finite symbolic dynamical system for the continuous dynamics of each location. We show that this can be done for a quite general class of hybrid systems defined on o-minimal structures. In particular, we recover the main result of a paper by G. Lafferriere, G.J. Pappas, and S. Sastry, on o-minimal hybrid systems. We also provide an analysis and extension of results on decidability and complexity of problems and constructions related to o-minimal hybrid systems. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We use AND-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) extended with linear constraints (LinAICs) as symbolic representation of the hybrid state space, and show how methods for maintaining compactness of AIGs can be lifted to support model-checking of linear hybrid systems with large discrete state spaces. This builds on a novel approach for eliminating sets of redundant constraints in such rich hybrid state representations by a suitable exploitation of the capabilities of SMT solvers, which is of independent value beyond the application context studied in this paper. We used a benchmark derived from an Airbus flap control system (containing 2(20) discrete states) to demonstrate the relevance of the approach.},

abstract = {We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior of real-time systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many real-valued clocks. A timed automaton accepts timed words-infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both B??chi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the paper is an (PSPACE) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also prove that the universality problem and the language inclusion problem are solvable only for the deterministic automata: both problems are undecidable (??11-hard) in the nondeterministic case and PSPACE-complete in the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss the application of this theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of finite-state systems. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {A hybrid system consists of a collection of digital programs that interact with each other and with an analog environment. Examples of hybrid systems include medical equipment, manufacturing controllers, automotive controllers, and robots. The formal analysis of the mixed digital-analog nature of these systems requires a model that incorporates the discrete behavior of computer programs with the continuous behavior of environment variables, such as temperature and pressure. Hybrid automata capture both types of behavior by combining finite automata with differential inclusions (i.e. differential inequalities). HyTech is a symbolic model checker for linear hybrid automata, an expressive, yet automatically analyzable, subclass of hybrid automata. A key feature of HyTech is its ability to perform parametric analysis, i.e. to determine the values of design parameters for which a linear hybrid automaton satisfies a temporal requirement.},

@article{Araiza-Illan2014,
abstract = {Thi paper presents the deductive formal verification of high-level properties of control systems with theorem proving, using the Why3 tool. Properties that can be verified with this approach include stability, feedback gain, and robustness, among others. For the systems, modelled in Simulink, we propose three main steps to achieve the verification: specifying the properties of interest over the signals within the model using Simulink blocks, an automatic translation of the model into Why3, and the automatic verification of the properties with theorem provers in Why3. We present a methodology to specify the properties in the model and a library of relevant assertion blocks (logic expressions), currently in development. The functionality of the blocks in the Simulink models are automatically translated to Why3 as `theories' and verification goals by our tool implemented in MATLAB. A library of theories in Why3 corresponding to each supported block has been developed to facilitate the process of translation. The goals are automatically verified in Why3 with relevant theorem provers. A simple first-order discrete system is used to exemplify the specification of the Simulink model, the translation process from Simulink to the Why3 formal logic language, and the verification of Lyapunov stability.},

@article{Girard2006,
abstract = {Approximate simulation relations have been introduced as a powerful tool for the approximation of discrete and continuous systems. Approximation of purely discrete systems has traditionally been based on language inclusion and equivalence with notions such as simulation or bisimulation relations. These concepts have been useful for simplifying problems such as safety verification or controller synthesis. When dealing with continuous and hybrid systems, typically observed over the real numbers with possibly noisy observations, the usual notions based on ezact language inclusion is quite restrictive and not robust. The notion of language approximation is much more adequate in this context. It proposes a framework for system approximation based on approximate versions of simulation relations. Instead of requiring that the observations of a system and its approximation are and remain equal, one requires that they are and remain arbitrarily close. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We establish a phase transition for permutation classes (downsets of permutations under the permutation containment order): there is an algebraic number kappa, approximately 2.20557, for which there are only countably many permutation classes of growth rate (Stanley-Wilf limit) less than kappa but uncountably many permutation classes of growth rate kappa, answering a question of Klazar. We go on to completely characterize the possible sub-kappa growth rates of permutation classes, answering a question of Kaiser and Klazar. Central to our proofs are the concepts of generalized grid classes (introduced herein), partial well-order, and atomicity (also known as the joint embedding property).},
