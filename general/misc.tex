%     \item{Given a stochastic hybrid system, we use numerical tools to generate a finite state Markov chain, together with guarantees on the level of approximation introduced in the process. The properties of the Markov chain (in our case the probability of remaining in a certain region of the state space) are then analyzed using a model checker. The result is combined with the approximation guarantees to provide an overall guarantee about the probability of satisfying the original property of interest for the stochastic hybrid system.}

%     \item{We develop algorithms for invariant verification of hybrid systems using discrete approximations based on predicate abstractions. Consider a hybrid automaton with $n$ continuous variables and a set $L$ of locations. Then the continuous state-space is $L\times\mathbb{R}^{n}$. For the sake of efficiency, we restrict our attention where all invariants, switching guards, and discrete updates of the hybrid automaton are specified by linear expressions, and the continuous dynamics is linear, possibly with bounded input. For the purpose of abstraction, the user supplies initial predicates $p_1,\ldots, p_k$, where each predicate is a polyhedral subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In the abstract program, the $n$ continuous variables are replaced by $k$ discrete boolean variables. A combination of values to these $k$ boolean variables represents an abstract state, and the abstract state space is $L \times \mathbb{B}^{k}$. Our verifier performs an on-the-fly search of the abstract system by symbolic manipulation of polyhedra.}
