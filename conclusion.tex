We have shown that the different types of probabilistic hybrid automata can be translated into a probabilistic timed automaton, which then can be verified. The chain of translations is from a probabilistic rectangular to multisingular to stopwatch to timed automaton. Similarly, stochastic hybrid automata can be abstracted to probabilistic timed automata. Discrete time stochastic automata on the other hand can be abstracted to discrete time markov chains. All these translations and abstractions preserve the properties that can be asked of probabilistic hybrid systems, using probabilistic timed logic formulae.

Being able to verify properties of probabilistic hybrid systems is essential as many real world applications can be represented as probabilistic hybrid automata, as for example the behaviour of the environment is probabilistic.
