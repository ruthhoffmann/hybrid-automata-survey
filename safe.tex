\subsection{Non-Probabilistic System and Logics}
There are different types of abstraction techniques that can be applied to hybrid automata, we will discuss these in the sections below. What these techniques have in common is that they construct a discrete \emph{transition system} and they show that the abstraction preserves the properties of the original system. Some of the techniques use the properties to build partitions of the hybrid system, which then are abstracted.
\begin{defi}[Transition System \cite{Alur2000}]
A \emph{transition system} $\mathcal{T}=(Q,Q_{0},\Pi,t,\models)$ consists of
\begin{description}
    \item[$Q$]{the finite set of states;}
    \item[$Q_{0}\subseteq Q$]{the set of initial states;}
    \item[$\Pi$]{the set of propositions;}
    \item[$t \subseteq Q\times Q$]{a transition function;}
    \item[$\models\subseteq Q\times\Pi$]{a satisfaction function.}
\end{description}
\end{defi}

The \emph{properties} of a system are desired specifications, such as avoiding an unsafe set of states, that the system satisfies. Properties are used to formally verify the system and are described using logical formulae built from atomic propositions.

We denote by $\llbracket \phi \rrbracket = \{ q\in Q : q\models \phi\}$ the set of states satisfying the property $\phi$.

%%% LTL

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{defi}[Linear Temporal Logic]
The formulae of \emph{linear temporal logic} (LTL) are defined recursively
\begin{description}
    \item[Propositions]{Every atomic proposition $\phi$ is a formula.}
    \item[Formulas]{If $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ are formulae then so are the following;
        \[
        \phi_{1} \lor \phi_{2},\ \ \phi_{1} \land \phi_{2}, \ \ \lnot \phi_{1}, \ \
        \phi_{1} \Rightarrow \phi_{2},\ \ \phi_{1} \Leftrightarrow \phi_{2}, \ \ \bigcirc \phi_{1}, \ \ \phi_{1} \until \phi_{2}, \ \ \lozenge \phi_{1}, \ \ \square \phi_{1}.
        \]}
\end{description}
\end{defi}
Where the formulae are interpreted over infinite words of propositions. Let $w=\Pi_{0}\Pi_{1}\ldots$ be a word with $\Pi_{i}$ being a set of propositions, then the satisfaction of a proposition $\phi$ at position $i\in \mathbb{N}$ of $w$ is denoted by $(w,i)\models_{L} \phi$ and holds if and only if $\phi \in \Pi_{i}$. Note that $\models_{L}$ is not the satisfaction relation $\models$ of a transition system.

\begin{defi}[Semantics of LTL]
Let $\phi_{1},\phi_{2}$ be LTL formulae, $w$ a word of propositions, and $i\in\mathbb{N}$. The semantics of any LTL formula is defined recursively as
\begin{itemize}
    \item{$(w,i)\models_{L}\phi_{1}\lor\phi_{2}$ if either $(w,i)\models_{L}\phi_{1}$ or $(w,i)\models_{L}\phi_{2}$;}
    \item{$(w,i)\models_{L}\phi_{1}\land\phi_{2}$ if both $(w,i)\models_{L}\phi_{1}$ and $(w,i)\models_{L}\phi_{2}$;}
    \item{$(w,i)\models_{L}\lnot\phi_{1}$ if $(w,i)\not\models_{L}\phi_{1}$;}
    \item{$(w,i)\models_{L}\phi_{1}\Rightarrow\phi_{2}$ if $(w,i)\models_{L}\lnot\phi_{1} \land \phi_{2}$;}
    \item{$(w,i)\models_{L}\phi_{1}\Leftrightarrow\phi_{2}$ if $(w,i)\models_{L}(\phi_{1}\Rightarrow\phi_{2})\land(\phi_{2}\Rightarrow\phi_{1})$;}
    \item{$(w,i)\models_{L}\bigcirc\phi_{1}$ if $(w,i+1)\models_{L}\phi_{1}$;}
    \item{$(w,i)\models_{L}\phi_{1}\until\phi_{2}$ if there is $j\geq i$ such that $(w,j)\models_{L}\phi_{2}$ and for all $i\leq k < j$ $(w,k)\models_{L}\phi_{1}$;}
    \item{$(w,i)\models_{L}\lozenge\phi_{1}$ if $(w,i)\models_{L}true\until\phi_{1}$;}
    \item{$(w,i)\models_{L}\square\phi_{1}$ if $(w,i)\models_{L}\lnot\lozenge\lnot\phi_{1}$.}
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

The \emph{next} operator $\bigcirc\phi$ holds for a word $\Pi_{0}\Pi_{1}\Pi_{2}\ldots$ if and only if $\phi$ holds for $\Pi_{1}\Pi_{2}\ldots$. The \emph{until} operator $\phi_{1}\until\phi_{2}$ describes that $\phi_{1}$ is true until $\phi_{2}$ becomes true. The \emph{eventually} operator $\lozenge\phi$ indicates that $\phi$ will be true at some point in $w$. The \emph{always} operator $\square\phi$ describes that $\phi$ must always be true in a word.

\begin{ex}[LTL Examples]
The LTL formula to express that the proposition $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ both hold at the same time in a word $w\in L$ at some letter $w_{i}$ until $w_{j}$, with $j\geq i$, at which letter $\not \phi_{1}$ holds is expressed as
\[
(w,i)\models_{L}(\phi_{1}\land\phi_{2})\until \lnot \phi_{1}.
\]
We can express that if $\phi_{1}$ always holds in a word $w\in L$ then eventually $\phi_{2}$ will hold in $w$,
\[
(w,i)\models_{L}\square\phi_{1}\Rightarrow\lozenge\phi_{2}.
\]
\end{ex}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% CTL
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We can extend LTL to include existential quantifiers. These types of quantifiers are used in property formulations of transition systems and the satisfaction relation of correlates to the satisfaction relation of this extended logic.

\begin{defi}[Computational Tree Logic]
The formulae of \emph{Computational temporal logic} (CTL) are defined recursively
\begin{description}
    \item[Propositions]{Every atomic proposition $\phi$ is a formula.}
    \item[Formulas]{If $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ are formulae then so are the following;
    \begin{align*}
        & \phi_{1} \lor \phi_{2},\ \ \phi_{1} \land \phi_{2}, \ \ \lnot \phi_{1}, \ \
        \phi_{1} \Rightarrow \phi_{2},\ \ \phi_{1} \Leftrightarrow \phi_{2}, \\
        & \exists\bigcirc \phi_{1}, \ \ \phi_{1} \exists\until \phi_{2}, \ \
        \exists\lozenge \phi_{1}, \ \ \exists\square \phi_{1}, \\
        & \forall\bigcirc \phi_{1}, \ \ \forall\lozenge \phi_{1}, \ \ \forall\square \phi_{1}.
    \end{align*}}
\end{description}
\end{defi}

The difference between LTL and CTL semantics is that LTL is interpreted over words, whereas CTL is interpreted over trees generated by trajectories from a given state of a transition system. So a transition system $\mathcal{T}$ satisfies a proposition $\phi$ if there is a state $q_{0}\in Q$ in $\mathcal{T}$ such that $q_{0}\models \phi$.
\begin{defi}[Semantics of CTL]
Let $q_{0}\in Q$ be a state of a transition system $\mathcal{T}$, and $\phi_{1},\phi_{2}$ CTL formulae, then the semantics of CTL is defined as
\begin{itemize}
    \item{$q_{0}\models\phi_{1}\lor\phi_{2}$ if either $q_{0}\models\phi_{1}$ or $q_{0}\models\phi_{2}$;}
    \item{$q_{0}\models\phi_{1}\land\phi_{2}$ if both $q_{0}\models\phi_{1}$ and $q_{0}\models\phi_{2}$;}
    \item{$q_{0}\models\lnot\phi_{1}$ if $q_{0}\not\models\phi_{1}$;}
    \item{$q_{0}\models\phi_{1}\Rightarrow\phi_{2}$ if $q_{0}\models\lnot\phi_{1} \land \phi_{2}$;}
    \item{$q_{0}\models\phi_{1}\Leftrightarrow\phi_{2}$ if $q_{0}\models(\phi_{1}\Rightarrow\phi_{2})\land(\phi_{2}\Rightarrow\phi_{1})$;}
    \item{$q_{0}\models\exists\bigcirc\phi_{1}$ if $\exists q_{1}\in Q$ such that
    $t(q_{0})=q_{1}$ and $q_{1}\models \phi_{1}$;}
    \item{$q_{0}\models\phi_{1}\exists\until\phi_{2}$ if $\exists q_{0}q_{1}q_{2}\ldots$ a trajectory generated from $q_{0}$ such that $q_{i}\models \phi_{2}$ for some $i\geq 0$ and for all $0\leq j < i$, $q_{j}\models \phi_{1}$;}
    \item{$q_{0}\models\exists\lozenge\phi_{1}$ if $q_{0}\models true\ \exists\until \phi_{1}$;}
    \item{$q_{0}\models\exists\square\phi_{1}$ if $\exists q_{0}q_{1}q_{2}\ldots$ generated from $q_{0}$ such that $\forall i\geq 0$ $q_{i}\models\phi_{1}$;}

    \item{$q_{0}\models\forall\bigcirc\phi_{1}$ if $q_{0}\models\lnot\exists\bigcirc\lnot\phi_{1}$;}
    \item{$q_{0}\models\forall\lozenge\phi_{1}$ if $q_{0}\models\lnot\exists\square\lnot\phi_{1}$;}
    \item{$q_{0}\models\forall\square\phi_{1}$ if $q_{0}\models\lnot\exists\lozenge\lnot\phi_{1}$.}
\end{itemize}
\end{defi}

The temporal operators $\exists\bigcirc, \exists\until, \exists\lozenge$ and $\exists\square$ are called \emph{possibly next}, \emph{possibly until}, \emph{possibly eventually} and \emph{possibly always} respectively and they refer to the existence of a trajectory starting at a given state. On the other hand, the operators $\forall\bigcirc$ (inevitably next), $\forall\lozenge$ (inevitably eventually) and $\forall\square$ (inevitably always) refer to all trajectories from a given state.

In general we can say that a transition system $\mathcal{T}$ \emph{satisfies} a CTL formula $\phi$ if some initial state of $\mathcal{T}$ satisfies $\phi$.

\begin{ex}[CTL Examples]
The CTL formula
\[
q_{0}\models \phi_{1}\exists\until\forall\bigcirc \phi_{2}
\]
expresses, that there is a path in $\mathcal{T}$ starting at state $q_{0}$ on which $\phi_{1}$ holds until it is inevitable that in the next state $\phi_{2}$ holds.
We write
\[
q_{0}\models\forall\square((\phi_{1}\lor\phi_{2})\land\exists\lozenge\phi_{3})
\]
to mean that on all paths starting at $q_{0}$ in $\mathcal{T}$ it is true that either $\phi_{1}$ or $\phi_{2}$ hold and eventually $\phi_{3}$ might hold too.
\end{ex}

\begin{defi}[Probabilistic Transition System]
A \emph{probabilistic transition system} $\mathcal{P}=(Q,Q_{0},L,A,t)$

\begin{description}
    \item[$Q$] (possibly uncountable) set of states
    \item[$Q_{0}\subseteq Q$] set of initial states
    \item[$L:Q\rightarrow 2^{AP}$] labelling function, which assigns to each state a set of propositions.

\end{defi}


\begin{defi}[Adversary]
An \emph{adversary} or scheduler of a probabilistic transition system $\mathcal{P}$ is a function $\mathcal{A}$ mapping every finite path $\pi$ of $\mathcal{P}$ to a distribution such that $\mathcal{A}(\pi)\in t(last(\pi),a)$, where $a\in A$. Let $Adv$ be the set of all adversaries of $\mathcal{P}$.

We can extend CTL further to include probabilistic timed properties. For that we will introduce the probabilistic temporal logic \emph{Probabilistic Branching Time Logic} (PBTL) \cite{Baier1998}.

\begin{defi}[Probabilistic Branching Time Logic]

The PBTL formula

We write
\[
q_{0}\models\left[\forall\square((\phi_{1}\lor\phi_{2})\land\exists\lozenge\phi_{3})\right]_{>0.1}
\]
to mean that with probability higher than $0.1$ all paths starting at $q_{0}$ in $\mathcal{T}$ it holds that either $\phi_{1}$ or $\phi_{2}$ hold and eventually $\phi_{3}$ might hold too.

To be able to model check a PTCTL formula of a PTA, we abstract the PTA to a probabilistic transition system. But In a PTS we are able to model PBTL formulae, for that we have to translate the PTCTL formula to another extended version of PBTL, which includes a reset quantifier. We call this logic \emph{PBTL$^{z}$}.
The set of atomic propositions for PBTL$^{z}$ is $[AP]=AP\cup\{\phi_{\zeta} : \zeta\in sub(\phi)\cap Zone(\mathcal{T},\phi)\}$, where $Zone(\mathcal{T},\phi)$ denotes the set of zones that are either in $Zone(\mathcal{T})$ (the set of all zones in invariants and guards of $\mathcal{T}$) or in $sub(\phi)$ (set of subformulae of $\phi$ including $\phi$).

\begin{defi}[Probabilistic Branching Time Logic Extended \cite{Sproston2001}]

\begin{ex}[PBTL$^{z}$ Example]
Taking the PTCTL formula from Example~\ref{ex:ptctl}, we can translate it to a PBTL$^{z}$ expressing the same property, namely with a probability of $0.99$ there is a path starting in $q$ on which first $x-y<10$ holds until $x-y=10$ and $\phi_{1}$ hold, and that all holds in exactly $5$ units of time.
\[
q,E\models_{Adv} z.\left[(\phi_{x-y<10}\until(\phi_{x-y=10}\land\phi_{1}))\land z=5\right]_{\geq0.99}.

\subsection{General Verification Problems}
There are general questions that we can ask of a system which we are looking to be verified for example, we reach all possible states of the system.

\begin{prob}[Reachability Problem \cite{Henzinger2000}]
\label{prob:reach}
Given a hybrid automaton $\mathcal{A}$ and a proposition $\phi$. Is there a trajectory in the hybrid automaton that starts in an initial state and reaches a state $(l_{i},v)\in L\times\val(V)$ such that $(l_{i},v)\models\phi$?
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[Emptiness Problem \cite{Henzinger2000}]
\label{prob:empty}
Given a hybrid automaton $\mathcal{A}$, is there a divergent trajectory starting in an initial state?
\end{prob}

%A \emph{timed trace} in a hybrid automaton is
%\begin{prob}[Timed Trace Inclusion Problem \cite{Henzinger2000}]
%\label{prob:time}
%Given two hybrid automata $\mathcal{A}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{2}$, is every timed trace in $\mathcal{A}_{1}$ also a timed trace in $\mathcal{A}_{2}$
%\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[LTL Model Checking Problem \cite{Alur2000}]
\label{prob:ltl}
Given a hybrid automaton $\mathcal{A}$ and a LTL formula $\phi$ , determine if $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies $\phi$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}[CTL Model Checking Problem \cite{Alur2000}]
\label{prob:ctl}
Given a hybrid automaton $\mathcal{A}$ and a CTL formula $\phi$ , determine if $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies $\phi$.
\end{prob}



% \subsection{Running Example}
% Figure~\ref{fig:UAV} is the hybrid automaton which will be abstracted in with each technique. Some abstractions call for a specific type of hybrid automaton, we will adjust the components accordingly and draw the new automaton.
%
% The example hybrid system that we use is a simplified scenario of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) taking off to height $H_{1}$, move forward over a distance of $M$ or ascend higher to height $H_{2}$. The UAV will not start landing until it has reached the distance $M$.
% There are many different properties we can investigate in this hybrid system, we will consider the following three questions:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item{Will the UAV take off, fly at height $H_{1}$ before landing?}
%     \item{Will the UAV ever reach height $H_{2}$?}
%     \item{Will the UAV fly forward, then go higher and then fly on?}
% \end{itemize}

%
% Formally, the hybrid automaton in Figure~\ref{fig:UAV} consists of the following:
% \begin{align*}
% V & = \{x,z\} \text{ with } \val(V)\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{2} \\
% L & = \{l_{0},l_{1}, l_{2}, l_{3}, l_{4}\} \\
% A & = \{ \text{Take Off, Move, Boost, Enough Height, Land, Landed} \} \\
% \Init & = \{(l_{0},(0,0))\} \\
% \Inv(l_{0}) & = (0,0),\ \ \Inv(l_{1}) = (0,[0,H_{1}]),\ \ \Inv(l_{2}) = ([0,M],[H_{1},H_{2}]),\\
% \Inv(l_{3}) & = ([0,M],[H_{1},H_{2}]), \ \ \Inv(l_{4})=([0,M],[0,H_{2}]) \\
% f(l_{0}) &=(\dot{x}=0,\dot{z}=0),\ \ f(l_{1})=(\dot{x}=0,\dot{z}=a),\ \ f(l_{2})=(\dot{x}=cx,\dot{z}=0),\\
% f(l_{3}) &=(\dot{x}=0,\dot{z}=b), \ \ f(l_{4}) = (\dot{x}=0,\dot{z}=-a) \\
% E & = \{e_{1}=(l_{0},\text{Take Off},l_{1}),\ e_{2}=(l_{1},\text{Move},l_{2}),\  e_{3}=(l_{2},\text{Boost},l_{3}),\\
% & e_{4}=(l_{3},\text{Enough Height},l_{2}),\  e_{5}=(l_{2},\text{Land},l_{4}),\ e_{6}=(l_{4},\text{Landed},l_{0})\} \\
% g(e_{1}) & =\emptyset,\ \ g(e_{2})=(\emptyset,H_{1}),\ \ g(e_{3})=\emptyset, \ \ g(e_{4})=(\emptyset,H_{2}),\ \ g(e_{5})=(M, \emptyset),\ \ g(e_{6})=(\emptyset,0) \\
% r(e_{1}) & =(x,z),\ \ r(e_{2})=(x,z),\ \ r(e_{3})=(x,z),\ \ r(e_{4})=(x,z),\ \ r(e_{5}) = (x,z),\ \ r(e_{6})=(0,z) \\
% \end{align*}
%
% The three properties can be written in CTL as
% \[
% (x=0 \land z=0) \until (x=0 \land z>0) \until (z=H_{1}) \until (z<H_{1})
% \]
% \[
% \exists\lozenge (z=H_{2})

% \[
% \forall \lozenge (z>0 \until \bigcirc z=0)
